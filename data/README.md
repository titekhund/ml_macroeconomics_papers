# Data Resources for Machine Learning in Macroeconomics

This directory contains data files and resources used in the machine learning implementations for macroeconomic models.

## Directory Structure

- `images/`: Visualizations and figures related to macroeconomic models
- Model files and saved neural network weights

## Data Files

The data files in this directory are primarily model outputs and saved neural network weights from the implementations in the code directory. These files can be used to reproduce results without having to retrain the models.

## Usage

The data files are referenced in the corresponding Jupyter notebooks in the code directory. To use these files:

1. Load the appropriate data file in the corresponding notebook
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook for using pre-trained models or visualizing results

## Source Repositories

The data in this directory has been collected from the following repositories:

1. [ML_Macro](https://github.com/yniu87/ML_Macro) by Yuanhao Niu
2. [macro_ML](https://github.com/yangycpku/macro_ML) by Yucheng Yang
