# Code Implementations for Machine Learning in Macroeconomics

This directory contains code implementations for various machine learning techniques applied to macroeconomic models.

## Directory Structure

- `growth_models/`: Implementations of growth models using machine learning techniques
- `forecasting/`: Code for macroeconomic forecasting using ML methods
- `structural_estimation/`: Code for structural model estimation using ML approaches

## Growth Models

The `growth_models/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks implementing neoclassical growth models using neural networks and deep learning techniques:

1. **NCG_1D.ipynb**: Neoclassical Growth Model with Capital (1-dimensional)
2. **NCG_2D.ipynb**: Neoclassical Growth Model with Capital and TFP shocks (2-dimensional)
3. **NCG_TD.ipynb**: Neoclassical Growth Model using Temporal Difference learning
4. **NGM.ipynb** and **NGM2.ipynb**: Alternative implementations of Neoclassical Growth Models
5. **Duarte_algorithm.ipynb**: Implementation of Duarte's algorithm for continuous-time economics

These notebooks demonstrate how deep learning techniques can be used to solve macroeconomic models that are traditionally solved using numerical methods like finite differences or projection methods.

## Source Repositories

The code in this directory has been collected from the following repositories:

1. [ML_Macro](https://github.com/yniu87/ML_Macro) by Yuanhao Niu - Contains implementations of macroeconomic models using deep learning
2. [macro_ML](https://github.com/yangycpku/macro_ML) by Yucheng Yang - Course materials on Macroeconomic Analysis with Machine Learning and Big Data

## Usage

To run these notebooks, you'll need:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Each notebook is self-contained with explanations of the models and implementation details.
